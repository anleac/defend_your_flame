# defend_your_flame

Inspired by a classic game I grew up with as a kid.

### What is the game?
It is a very simple, side on, round based game where you are trying to defend your castle from an ever increasing onslaught of enemies.

Defend your base, by using throwing the enemies into the air, and upgrade your bases defenses.

See how long you can last!

### Why are you re-making this?
I'd like to do a small project that uses Flame, as an experiment, and then host it on my GitHub for free.

### Want to contribute?
Feel free to open a code change, or open an issue, I'll respond to it!

### Git tips
